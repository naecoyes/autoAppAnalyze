# Auto APK Analyzer - Project Summary

## Project Overview

The Auto APK Analyzer is a comprehensive automated framework for analyzing Android applications (APKs) to discover hidden APIs and endpoints that are difficult to detect through traditional scanning methods. The system combines static extraction, dynamic interception, and component enumeration techniques to provide thorough coverage of application attack surfaces.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Static Analysis Subsystem
- **JADX Integration**: Decompiles APKs and extracts hardcoded URLs, endpoints, and strings
- **APKLeaks Integration**: Scans for URIs, endpoints, and secrets in APK files
- **MobSF Integration**: Performs comprehensive static analysis with certificate and permission checking
- **URL Normalization**: Standardizes and deduplicates URLs with parameter templating

### 2. Dynamic Analysis Module
- **Frida Certificate Pinning Bypass**: Implements scripts to bypass SSL/TLS certificate validation
- **Traffic Interception**: Captures real API traffic using proxy tools
- **Flutter App Support**: Specialized handling for Flutter applications with dedicated TLS bypass
- **App Behavior Triggering**: Uses Monkey and UIAutomator for comprehensive app interaction

### 3. Component Enumeration System
- **Drozer Integration**: Enumerates exported activities, services, receivers, and content providers
- **Content URI Validation**: Probes content:// URIs for accessibility and data structure
- **Risk Annotation**: Identifies high-risk components and endpoints

### 4. Specialized Flutter Handling
- **Flutter Detection**: Identifies Flutter apps through assets and native libraries
- **TLS Bypass**: Implements BoringSSL function hooking for certificate validation bypass
- **Traffic Routing**: Configures proxy settings for Flutter network traffic

### 5. URL Mapping and Normalization
- **Data Consolidation**: Unifies findings from static, dynamic, and component sources
- **Path Parameter Templating**: Normalizes dynamic paths with parameter placeholders
- **Risk Classification**: Categorizes endpoints by security risk level
- **Evidence Tracking**: Maintains traceability to discovery sources

### 6. Workflow Management
- **Predefined Flows**: Structured analysis pipelines for different use cases
- **Task Hierarchy**: Supports complex workflows with parent/child task relationships
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status monitoring and reporting

### 7. Developer Organization
- **App Grouping**: Automatically organizes apps by developer/organization
- **Workspace Management**: Creates structured directories for analysis results
- **Result Storage**: Saves findings in organized JSON format

## Technical Architecture

### Core Modules
1. **Device Management**: ADB-based package enumeration and APK retrieval
2. **Static Analyzer**: JADX, APKLeaks, and MobSF integration
3. **Dynamic Analyzer**: Frida hooking and traffic capture
4. **Component Enumerator**: Drozer-based component discovery
5. **Flutter Handler**: Specialized processing for Flutter applications
6. **URL Mapper**: Data consolidation and normalization
7. **Task Manager**: Workflow orchestration and progress tracking
8. **Workspace Manager**: File organization and result storage
